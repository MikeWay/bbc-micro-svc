This is an attempt to show that virtualisation can be quicker than running natively

In theory, start two instances in different AZ's

Two projects:

/home/mjrw/Documents/BBC-Microservices/Source/docker/PerfTestClient

/home/mjrw/Documents/BBC-Microservices/Source/docker/PerfTestServer

Also a composition in PerfTestCompose

The docker images are pushed as mjrw/perftesclient and mjrw/perftestserver

Environment variable ENV_BASE_PATH=http://server:8092/v1 can be used to change the server running when you launch docker


In principle, just run docker-compose up from /home/mjrw/Documents/BBC-Microservices/Source/docker/PerfTestCompose
