Oh what fun!

1) Generate 3 services using Swagger editor
	2 / 3 Yamls saved here

2) Nice to show the auto mock (look at baseurl in YAML)

3) Careful: as at some point the Yaml for client generation must be edited

4) Generate / download each service as NodeJS

5) Edit index.js to change the port for each one

6) Run each with npm start

7) Show the test page (URL docs in terminal)

8) Create a 4th service (Catalog)

9) Convert the service to support typescript

10) Generate nodejs typescript client and add to project
	

11) See /home/mjrw/Documents/BBC-Microservices/Source/nodejs-services

**) Could wrap these services as a docker composition :-)

**) Note the URL ends up looking like: http://localhost:8099/MikeWay/Catalog/1.0.0/product/1


***) I've moved the service files to docker/ServicesToAggreate and created a docker image: docker run -it -P services-to-aggregate:latest
